This repository contains five software projects demonstrating concepts such as embedded simulation, shell scripting, data structures, dynamic memory, function pointers, file handling, and multi-threading.

📌 Project 1: Smart Traffic Control and Monitoring System (C Simulation)
Overview

This project simulates an intelligent multi-intersection traffic control system using the C programming language.
It models traffic behavior using data structures, dynamic memory, timers, and simulated concurrency (using non-blocking time checks with clock() or time()).

This project replicates embedded system behavior without requiring physical hardware.

Key Functionalities
1. Traffic Signal Simulation

Two or more intersections.

Each intersection uses:

Red / Yellow / Green states.

Timers for each phase.

Dynamic adjustment of signal timing based on traffic density.

2. Vehicle Detection Simulation

Vehicle presence simulated using:

Keyboard input, OR

Randomized vehicle arrival generator.

Vehicle counts stored using dynamic structures.

3. Dynamic Memory Management

Each lane maintains a dynamic queue of vehicles using:

malloc()

realloc()

free()

Safe memory handling with null-checking.

4. Simulated Concurrency

Multiple "tasks" run concurrently by:

Checking timestamps instead of using sleep().

Example tasks:

Traffic light control

Vehicle addition/removal

Data logging

Allows “parallel” simulation inside a single-threaded C program.

5. Logging & File Handling

Logs traffic data to a file:

Lane ID

Number of vehicles

Average wait time

Signal state

Timestamp

Appends each cycle for persistence.

6. Error Handling

Detects impossible states (e.g., two greens).

Protects against:

Memory leaks

Invalid pointer use

Failed allocations

7. User Interface

Interactive text menu:

Show current signal states

Display traffic statistics

Trigger manual override (emergency mode)

Export logs

Q📌 Project 2: Automated System Monitoring Shell Script
Overview

A Linux shell script that monitors system resources and provides an interactive menu to view system status, set alert thresholds, and manage logs.

Key Features

Resource Monitoring

CPU, memory, disk, running processes.

Uses top, free, df, ps.

Automation & Alerts

User-defined thresholds.

Auto-logging of warnings.

Logging

All data timestamped and saved to a log file.

Options to view or clear logs.

Interactive Menu

View system status

Set thresholds

View logs

Clear logs

Exit

Robustness

Graceful handling of invalid inputs.

Missing command detection.

Technologies

Bash scripting

Cron or loop-based scheduling

📌 Project 3: Student Management System using Structures (C)
Overview

A complete student information system using structures, dynamic memory, file handling, searching, sorting, and statistical analysis.

Key Features

Dynamic Data Structures

Student records: ID, name, age, course, grades[], GPA.

Uses malloc, realloc, free.

Persistent Storage

Save/load records using text or binary files.

File integrity and error handling.

CRUD Operations

Add, display, update, delete student records.

All changes synced to file.

Searching & Sorting

Search by ID or name (linear / binary search).

Sort by GPA, name, or ID (Bubble / Insertion / Merge Sort).

Analytics

GPA statistics: average, median, highest, lowest.

Reports:

Top N students

Best per course

Course-wise averages

User Interface

Menu-driven CLI system.

Technologies

C programming

Structures & memory management

File I/O

📌 Project 4: Dynamic Math & Data Processing Engine (C)
Overview

A modular C engine using function pointers for dynamic runtime operation selection. Supports dataset modification and various math/data operations.

Key Features

Dynamic Function Dispatch

Operations selected via function pointers:

Sum

Average

Min / Max

Search

Ascending / descending sort

Dynamic Memory

Dataset grows/shrinks at runtime using malloc, realloc, free.

Interactive Menu

Add/edit data

Choose operations

View results

File Integration

Load dataset from file

Save processed results

Robustness

Invalid inputs

Empty dataset protection

Guaranteed memory cleanup

Technologies

C programming

Function pointers

File handling

📌 Project 5: Multi-threaded Web Scraper (C with pthreads)
Overview

A simple but powerful multi-threaded web scraper that downloads multiple webpages in parallel using POSIX threads.

Key Features

POSIX Threads

Each URL is fetched in its own thread.

No synchronization required.

Content Saving

Each thread stores HTML content in its own output file.

Error Handling

Unreachable URL detection.

Failed request handling.uit simulation
